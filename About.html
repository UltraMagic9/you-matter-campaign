        <h1>About + Inspiration</h1>
        <p>Our campaign was inspired by a book called “The War That Saved my Life.”
        The main character, Ada, is told by so many different people that she is 
        not worth taking care of and is extremely abused by her mother. I wanted to create 
        something that teaches people to not judge and take everyone into account.
        A big thanks to Kelly Barnhill, who wrote this amazing book. Don‘t forget to 
        read it! </p>
