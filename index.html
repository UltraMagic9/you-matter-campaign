        <p>
            Welcome to our campaign website! Our mission is to
        spread the message that everyone matters, and is worth 
        it despite what others might say. We believe that 
        everyone deserves the best possible life that they can have.
        Remember to spread the word through social media! #youmatter2018

        <h2>About + Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Our campaign was inspired by a book called The War That Saved my Life. The
        main character, Ada, was told by so many different people that she is not worth
        taking care of and was extremely neglected by her mother. I wanted to create something
        that teaches people not to judge and to take everyone into account. A big thanks to
        Kimberly Brubaker Bradley, who wrote this amazing book! Remember to read it!</p>
